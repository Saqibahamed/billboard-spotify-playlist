# Billboard Top 100 → Spotify Playlist 🎶

This Python project scrapes the **Billboard Hot 100** songs for a given date and automatically creates a **Spotify playlist** with those songs.  

It combines **BeautifulSoup** for web scraping with the **Spotify Web API** (via `spotipy`) to bring your favorite hits from the past into your Spotify library.
